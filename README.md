# DodgeBall

This is my development sandbox in an effort by the [NJ Hackers](http://www.meetup.com/NJ-Hackers/)
group to collaboratively work on creating an HTML5 driven game.

## Progressive Development

I'm going to try my best to write useful commit messages and also *create tags* where notable goals
have been achieved. So if you would like to go through the various steps of progress, it's probably
a good idea to step through the tags.
